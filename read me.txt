DATA PREPROCESSING
1. The train data was split according to 8 classes according to the labels given.
2. data was processed to a numerical form and changed dimensions.
3. the data was flatten to provide an input in cnn layers.
DESIGNING THE MODEL
1. using keras API I developed the model.
2. the model has Conv2D layer as input layer. with 32 filters, 5 kernel size, and activation function of relu. the images have been resized to 64*64.
3. Model next has a pooling layer, with pool size 4 and 2 as strides.
4. we repeat the layers again. with same things.
5.Add a flatten layer to input into fully connected layer.
6.input layer with 64 units of neuron, and with activation function 'relu'.
7.dropout layers with rate 0.3.
8.dense layer with 32 neuron with 'relu'.
9. output layer 8 units and 'softmax' function.
10. while compiling adam is the optimizer and loss function being sparse_categorical_crossentropy and metrics of accuracy.
11. trained the data on 10 epochs. 
12. found results for the test data. as final_predictions.
IMPOTANT NOTE: the code gonna give error if ran twice cause once data is systematically set up, the code wouldn't find it again!
To run again we need to make the folder the it was earlier!
